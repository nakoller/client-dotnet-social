# client-dotnet-social
Repository for dotnet clients for social networks (Yelp-only at the moment)

This repository will have Client libraries for various social networks as I implement them. 

At the moment, only Yelp is implemented and ready for use. 

To use the Yelp client, simply open app.config and replace the Token, TokenSecret, ConsumerKey and ConsumerSecret values with your own. If you don't have these, go to https://www.yelp.com/developers/manage_api_keys to register for your own.

There is not support to post reviews just yet. Working on that next.
